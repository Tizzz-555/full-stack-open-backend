# FullStackOpen (Backend)

This repository contains my solutions for _part 3_ of the "Full Stack Open" course by the University of Helsinki, hosted at [phonebook](https://part3-phonebook-fso.fly.dev/)

The solutions for this part are in a separate repository from the [main one](https://github.com/Tizzz-555/full-stack-open), as advised:

> It's recommended to do all of the exercises from this part into a new dedicated git repository, and place your source code right at the root of the repository. Otherwise, you will run into problems in exercise 3.10.
